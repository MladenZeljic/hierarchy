This is my old project from Advanced Computer Graphics. It represents simple game, where player collects energy orbs and avoids 
bombs.

It uses Hierarchical Modeling technique for drawing the whole setup of the game,including the cart, orbs, bombs, mountains, 
flowers and etc. Player can use keyboard keys in order to control the cart. Player results are then stored in json file,
for which they can be read or deleted when player wants to see its results.
